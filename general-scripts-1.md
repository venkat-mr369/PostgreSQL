### Understanding the Columns

The `pg_settings` view provides a wealth of information about your server's configuration. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most important columns in the script:

  * **`name`**: This is the name of the configuration parameter, like `shared_buffers` or `max_connections`.
  * **`setting`**: This is the **current, active value** of the parameter. This is the most important column for seeing what your server is actually using.
  * **`unit`**: For settings that have a unit (like memory or time), this column specifies it. Examples include `kB` for kilobytes, `s` for seconds, or `ms` for milliseconds.
  * **`source`**: This column tells you **how the current value was set**. Common values include:
      * `default`: The setting is using its built-in default value.
      * `configuration file`: The setting was defined in `postgresql.conf` or an included file.
      * `override`: The setting was changed with `ALTER SYSTEM`.
      * `client`: The setting was provided by the client when connecting.
  * **`boot_val`**: The value that the setting had when the server instance was last started. This is useful for seeing if a setting was changed after the server was booted.
  * **`reset_val`**: The value the parameter will have after the next configuration reload (`pg_ctl reload` or `SELECT pg_reload_conf()`). This can differ from `boot_val` and `setting`.
  * **`pending_restart`**: A boolean (`t` or `f`) indicating whether you need to **restart the PostgreSQL server** for the new value to take effect. If this is `t`, the current `setting` is not the one being used by the server.
