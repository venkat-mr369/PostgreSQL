Good question 👍 — **Two-Phase Locking (2PL)** is a fundamental **concurrency control method** in databases (including PostgreSQL transaction manager concepts).

Let me explain it in **interview style with examples** 👇

---

### 🔑 What is Two-Phase Locking (2PL)?

* It’s a **protocol to ensure serializability** in transactions.
* A transaction has **two phases** when acquiring/releasing locks:

1. **Growing Phase** → Transaction can **acquire locks** but **cannot release** any.
2. **Shrinking Phase** → Transaction can **release locks**, but **cannot acquire new ones**.

✅ This ensures transactions do not overlap in unsafe ways → prevents inconsistent data.

### 🧾 Example (Employees Salary Table)

Table:

| name   | salary |
| ------ | ------ |
| Meena  | 10000  |
| Yasoda | 30000  |
| Devi   | 15000  |

---

#### 👩‍💻 Transaction A (HR wants to update Meena)

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = 12000 WHERE name='Meena';
-- Lock acquired on row 'Meena' (growing phase)
```

At this point, Transaction A **holds a lock** on Meena’s row.

---

#### 👨‍💻 Transaction B (Finance wants to update Yasoda)

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = 32000 WHERE name='Yasoda';
-- Lock acquired on row 'Yasoda' (growing phase)
```

Transaction B **holds a lock** on Yasoda’s row.

---

#### ⚠️ If Transaction A tries:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET salary = 35000 WHERE name='Yasoda';
```

* It needs Yasoda’s row lock → but B already has it.
* So A **waits** until B finishes.

Meanwhile, B cannot ask for Meena’s row (locked by A), otherwise → **deadlock**.

---

#### ✅ When Transaction A commits:

```sql
COMMIT;
-- All locks released (shrinking phase)
```

Now Transaction B can proceed.

### 🔑 Why Two-Phase Locking is Vital

* **Guarantees serializability**: transactions behave as if executed one after the other.
* Prevents **lost updates**, **dirty reads**, **inconsistent states**.
* But it may cause **deadlocks** (when two transactions wait on each other).

## 🧠 Interview-Ready Short Answer

> “Two-Phase Locking is a concurrency protocol that ensures serializability. In the **growing phase**, a transaction can acquire locks but not release them. In the **shrinking phase**, it can release locks but not acquire new ones. For example, if HR updates Meena’s salary and Finance updates Yasoda’s, each holds a row lock. They cannot partially release locks, ensuring data consistency, but deadlocks may occur if both wait on each other.”

Perfect 👍 — this is a **very hot interview question**: *“What’s the difference between Two-Phase Locking (2PL) and MVCC?”*

Let’s break it into **definition → example → comparison table → interview-ready answer**.

---

### 🔑 Two-Phase Locking (2PL)

* Protocol for **serializability**.
* Two phases:

  1. **Growing** → transaction acquires locks.
  2. **Shrinking** → transaction releases locks.
* Readers/writers often **block each other**.
* Can cause **deadlocks**.

👉 Example:

* Transaction A locks Meena’s row.
* Transaction B tries to read Meena → must **wait** until A commits/rolls back.

---

### 🔑 MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)

* Used by PostgreSQL by default.
* Instead of locking readers/writers, Postgres creates **row versions**.
* Readers see a **snapshot** of data as of their transaction start.
* Writers create a new version of the row.
* Readers never block writers, and writers never block readers.

👉 Example:

* Transaction A updates Meena’s salary (10000 → 12000).
* Transaction B, running at the same time, **still sees 10000** until A commits.
* After A commits, new transactions see 12000.

### 📊 2PL vs MVCC Comparison

| Feature                 | Two-Phase Locking (2PL)                       | MVCC (Postgres)                                          |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Concurrency control** | Locks (shared/exclusive)                      | Row versions + snapshots                                 |
| **Readers vs Writers**  | Readers block writers, writers block readers  | Readers never block writers; writers don’t block readers |
| **Deadlocks**           | Possible (circular waits)                     | Rare for readers, possible only for writers on same row  |
| **Performance**         | Slower under heavy read workload              | High read concurrency (scales better)                    |
| **Consistency**         | Strict serializability                        | Snapshot isolation (by default)                          |
| **Use case**            | Legacy DBs (SQL Server, Oracle in some modes) | PostgreSQL, MySQL InnoDB, Oracle (multi-version mode)    |

### 🧠 Interview-Ready Short Answer

> “Two-Phase Locking ensures serializability by locking rows: once locks are acquired in the growing phase, they can’t be released until the shrinking phase. But it causes blocking between readers and writers.
> PostgreSQL uses MVCC instead, where each transaction sees a consistent snapshot. Writers create new row versions, so readers are never blocked. This makes Postgres highly concurrent compared to lock-based systems.”
