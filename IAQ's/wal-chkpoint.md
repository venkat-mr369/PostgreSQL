Great 👍 This is another very common interview area: **WAL & Checkpointer in PostgreSQL**.
Let me give you a **clear, step-by-step explanation with your Employees table example** so you can say it confidently.

# 🔑 What is WAL?

* WAL = **Write Ahead Log**.
* Every change in PostgreSQL (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) is **first written to WAL** before writing to data files.
* WAL ensures **Durability** (the “D” in ACID).
* If PostgreSQL crashes, it can **replay WAL** to restore consistent state.

👉 Think of WAL as a **black box recorder** of every change.

# 🔑 WAL Example (Employees Table)

Table:

| name   | salary |
| ------ | ------ |
| Meena  | 10000  |
| Yasoda | 30000  |
| Devi   | 15000  |

---

### 1️⃣ Transaction (HR updates Meena’s salary)

```sql
BEGIN;
UPDATE employees SET salary = 12000 WHERE name='Meena';
COMMIT;
```

### 2️⃣ What happens internally?

1. Postgres writes the change (`Meena 10000 → 12000`) **into WAL** (`pg_wal/` directory).
2. WAL is flushed to disk (fsync).
3. Later, the actual data page (table file) is updated.

✅ Even if the server crashes **after writing WAL but before writing the table file**, recovery will replay WAL → Meena = 12000 is preserved.

---

# 🔑 What is a Checkpointer?

* The **Checkpointer** is a background process in PostgreSQL.
* Its job = periodically **flush dirty pages (modified data) from memory (shared_buffers) to data files**.
* This prevents WAL from growing forever.

---

# 🔑 Checkpointer Example with Employees

1. HR updates Meena’s salary → goes to WAL + memory (shared_buffers).
2. Data file on disk still shows old salary (10000).
3. At checkpoint:

   * Checkpointer flushes memory to disk.
   * Now the data file shows new salary (12000).
   * WAL before this checkpoint can be recycled/archived.

✅ Without checkpointer → WAL would keep growing endlessly.

---

# 🔑 Why WAL + Checkpointer are Vital

* **WAL** = ensures durability & crash recovery.
* **Checkpointer** = ensures efficiency, reduces WAL size, and keeps data files up-to-date.

Together:

* WAL = “Write first, safe copy”.
* Checkpointer = “Eventually flush changes permanently”.

# 🧠 Interview-Ready Short Answer

> “In PostgreSQL, every change is first written to the **WAL (Write Ahead Log)** before the data file. WAL ensures durability and crash recovery.
> The **Checkpointer** process periodically flushes dirty pages from memory to disk and marks old WAL segments reusable.
>
> For example, if I update Meena’s salary from 10000 to 12000, the change goes into WAL first. Even if Postgres crashes before writing to the employees table, WAL replay will recover it. Later, the checkpointer flushes the update permanently into the employees data file.”
