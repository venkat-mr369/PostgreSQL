The `shared_buffers` parameter in PostgreSQL defines how much system memory PostgreSQL will use for its internal cache, known as the buffer pool. 
This critical memory area holds frequently accessed table and index data, which helps reduce disk I/O and boosts query performance.

### Overview & Purpose

- **Role:** Stores data pages in memory so that read/write operations can be performed much faster, avoiding frequent access to physical disk.
- **Default Value:** Typically set to 128MB, but you should increase this in production environments depending on available RAM.
- **Recommended Setting:** Often set to 25â€“40% of total system memory for database servers, balanced against other OS and PostgreSQL needs.
- **Physical Structure:** Value is specified in 8kB blocks; for example, `shared_buffers = 4GB` means PostgreSQL caches up to 4GB of data in RAM.

### How It Works

- When a query needs data, PostgreSQL first looks in shared_buffers. If not found there, it checks the OS cache, then eventually the disk.
- Modified (dirty) pages in shared_buffers are periodically written out to disk by the background writer, helping avoid performance spikes.

### Configuration

- Set in `postgresql.conf` with:
  ```
  shared_buffers = 4GB
  ```
- Changes require a PostgreSQL restart.
- Can also be set with:
  ```
  ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '512MB';
  ```
  followed by a restart.

### Cautions

- Over-allocating shared_buffers can reduce memory available for other vital processes (OS cache, sorting operations, maintenance tasks), so careful tuning is advised.

**In summary:**  
The `shared_buffers` parameter controls the primary memory cache for data in PostgreSQL, significantly impacting performance by reducing costly disk reads and writes.
